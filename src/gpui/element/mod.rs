//! Elements are the workhorses of GPUI. They are responsible for laying out and painting all of
//! the contents of a window. Elements form a tree and are laid out according to the web layout
//! standards as implemented by [taffy](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy). Most of the time,
//! you won't need to interact with this module or these APIs directly. Elements provide their
//! own APIs and GPUI, or other element implementation, uses the APIs in this module to convert
//! that element tree into the pixels you see on the screen.
//!
//! # Element Basics
//!
//! Elements are constructed by calling [`Render::render()`] on the root view of the window,
//! which recursively constructs the element tree from the current state of the application,.
//! These elements are then laid out by Taffy, and painted to the screen according to their own
//! implementation of [`Element::paint()`]. Before the start of the next frame, the entire element
//! tree and any callbacks they have registered with GPUI are dropped and the process repeats.
//!
//! But some state is too simple and voluminous to store in every view that needs it, e.g.
//! whether a hover has been started or not. For this, GPUI provides the [`Element::PrepaintState`], associated type.
//!
//! # Implementing your own elements
//!
//! Elements are intended to be the low level, imperative API to GPUI. They are responsible for upholding,
//! or breaking, GPUI's features as they deem necessary. As an example, most GPUI elements are expected
//! to stay in the bounds that their parent element gives them. But with [`Window::with_content_mask`],
//! you can ignore this restriction and paint anywhere inside of the window's bounds. This is useful for overlays
//! and popups and anything else that shows up 'on top' of other elements.
//! With great power, comes great responsibility.
//!
//! However, most of the time, you won't need to implement your own elements. GPUI provides a number of
//! elements that should cover most common use cases out of the box and it's recommended that you use those
//! to construct `components`, using the [`RenderOnce`] trait and the `#[derive(IntoElement)]` macro. Only implement
//! elements when you need to take manual control of the layout and painting process, such as when using
//! your own custom layout algorithm or rendering a code editor.
